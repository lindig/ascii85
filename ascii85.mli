val encode: string -> in_channel -> out_channel -> unit
(** [encode head ic oc] writes [head] to [oc] and then reads a byte stream
    from [ic] until the end and emits its Ascii85 encoding to [oc]. *)

val encode_file: string -> string -> unit
(** [encode_file head path] emits [head] and then reads a named file [path]
    and emits its Ascii85 encoding to standard output.  Opening and closing
    file [path] is handled by [encode_file]. *)
